# Academic-Knowledge-Graph
This project presents an innovative approach to streamline the process of identifying and understanding relevant scientific literature through the integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Knowledge Graphs (KGs). We propose a system that combines citation networks, contextual relevance, and semantic search capabilities to create an interconnected representation of research papers and their relationships. Our system facilitates dataset recommendations, author collaboration recommendations, domain-specific searches, context-aware summarization, and insights into citation reasoning, thereby enhancing the efficiency of literature reviews. By utilizing community detection algorithms, we identify influential papers and uncover emerging subareas, enabling a deeper understanding of academic fields. This research promises to transform how researchers interact with scientific literature, promoting more informed and interconnected scholarly work.
